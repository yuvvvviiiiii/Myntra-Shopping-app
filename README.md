Myntra-shopping-App
Overview
Myntra-Shopping-App is a dynamic and user-friendly shopping application designed using modern web development technologies. The frontend of the app is built with Vite and React.js, ensuring a fast and efficient user experience with a modular and component-based architecture. Vite, known for its lightning-fast development server and optimized build process, enhances the development workflow and performance.

On the backend, the app leverages Node.js, providing a robust and scalable server environment. Node.js enables the app to handle multiple requests efficiently, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions for users.

Together, these technologies create a seamless and engaging shopping experience, allowing users to browse, search, and purchase products with ease. The combination of Vite and React.js for the frontend, coupled with Node.js for the backend, ensures the Myntra-Shopping-App is both high-performing and scalable, ready to handle a growing user base and a wide range of features.. To run this project, you will need to use your own local code editor and development environment, as it requires running both the frontend and backend simultaneously on a local server.
